                    <p>My name is Mike Stevens. I was pretty sure that after I met my spouse on a dating website, I’d never have to write another About Me paragraph in my life, but here we are. Aside from my spouse, I have a lovely 2 and a half year old daughter.
                         Playing with her and watching her learn and grow is the light of my life.</p>

                    <p>When she’s sleeping, I enjoy reading books and playing video games. Primarily I play Destiny 2, which is actually good now, despite a really rough first year, so like, try it again. I read mostly fantasy and sci-fi novels, but I do love a solid detective story. 
                        Bonus points are given if the detective story takes place in a sci-fi or fantasy setting.</p>
                    <p>I worked for almost a decade as a Build Engineer/Service Engineer for a major software developer, but eventually the supporting technology reduced the need for a team of people that ensure software literally compiled. So, I’m branching out into web development. Most of my background is with strongly typed languages, so I look forward to disliking JavaScript magic and using TypeScript once the course is over. </p>
